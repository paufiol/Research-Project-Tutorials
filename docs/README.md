# Research Tutorial Design
---

## Problem Description

Tutorials are often the first contact a player has with a game, especially gameplay. This first impressions are key in order to engage the player from the start and theach them the necessary content to play. This segments are tipically short but very information dense, making mistakes common. In addition, failing to give a solid tutorial will harm the player experience of the whole game.

As with many other aspects of game design, this is no exact science. The approaches provided here are not perfect. However, by better understanding the concepts and play and mistakes and successes for the past we can learn to provide a smoother experience.


## Proposed approach

### Topics

A tutorial should intriduce the player to the plot or context, the mechanics and the controls. Keeping in mind these at all times will help have a compact tutorial, where everything is made to serve more than one purpose.

- **Context:** Allow the player to view the world he is set in, its basic rules (i.e. gravity), the character, and if necessary the plot.
 Often cinematics or scripted sequences can be placed before the tutorial to address this, at least partly. _(Defend the village from the horde!)_
- **Mechanics:** Show the rules of the game. Avoid forcing them to use them. Instead, strive for the player to discover by providing tips and with good level design. _(By firing the catapults)_
- **Controls:** Show the player how to interact with the game. In this aspect is specially key to limit how much information we give at once. Give only what is necessary, and let the player try by themselves. _(That aim using A-D, fire with W)_

Keep in mind that a tutorial is not limited to the start of the game. The tutorial only needs to teach you whatever is necessary at a given time. Your goal only needs to give momentum to the player until new elements are added to the board.

A good aim is to try to incorporate them as often as possible. For example, if the three examples above are put togheter they provide more information than the tree of them isolated. An opposite example would be mobile tutorials where arrows pop up and tell you where you tap. Since you only focus on tapping, only controls are explained and the user is left with little clue about what is he supposed to do.
