# Research Tutorial Design
---

## Problem Description

Tutorials are often the first contact a player has with a game, especially gameplay. This first impressions are key in order to engage the player from the start and theach them the necessary content to play. This segments are tipically short but very information dense, making mistakes common. In addition, failing to give a solid tutorial will harm the player experience of the whole game.

As with many other aspects of game design, this is no exact science. The approaches provided here are not perfect. However, by better understanding the concepts and play and mistakes and successes for the past we can learn to provide a smoother experience.


## Proposed approach

### Goals

A tutorial should intriduce the player to the plot or context, the mechanics and the controls. Keeping in mind these at all times will help have a compact tutorial, where everything is made to serve more than one purpose.

- **Context:** Allow the player to view the world he is set in, its basic rules (i.e. gravity), the character, and if necessary the plot.
 Often cinematics or scripted sequences can be placed before the tutorial to address this, at least partly.
